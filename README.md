# Earthquake Occurrence Rate Modeling ‚Äì Himalaya & North-Eastern India (GEAR1-based + ETAS Simulation)

## Project Overview

This repository presents a high-resolution earthquake occurrence rate model for the **Himalayan and North-Eastern (NE) regions of India**, combining **smoothed seismicity**, **strain-rate accumulation**, and **ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence)** simulation to quantify background and aftershock seismic hazard. This forms the basis for long-term seismic hazard assessment, catastrophe risk modeling, and financial risk forecasting.

## Objectives

- Model spatially gridded occurrence rates for **M ‚â• 4.95** earthquakes using historical seismicity and strain models.
- Apply the **Tapered Gutenberg-Richter (TGR)** magnitude-frequency distribution to forecast magnitude bin rates.
- Simulate **aftershock sequences** using a calibrated **ETAS model** (temporal, spatial, and magnitude kernels).
- Support long-term **risk-informed planning**, **insurance modeling**, and **urban seismic resilience**.

##  Features

### Core Occurrence Rate Modeling
- Declustering and magnitude completeness filtering on Indian catalog.
- Smoothed spatial occurrence via **Gaussian and Haversine kernel density estimation**.
- Magnitude binning from **M4.95 to M8.95** in 0.1 intervals with **TGR fitting**.
- Functional smoothing and **log-scaled visualizations** of Œª (expected number of events per grid cell).

###  ETAS Aftershock Simulation
- **ETAS Model Parameters** estimated via Maximum Likelihood:
  - **K** (productivity), **Œ±** (magnitude sensitivity), **c**, **p** (temporal), **d**, **q** (spatial).
- Recursive generation of triggered events using:
  - Spatial kernel: \[ f(r) ‚àù (r¬≤ + d)^{-q} \]
  - Temporal kernel: \[ g(t) ‚àù (t + c)^{-p} \]
- Output: Simulated catalogs of aftershock sequences seeded on primary (background) events.

### Visualization
- Gridded heatmaps at **0.1¬∞ √ó 0.1¬∞** and **0.5¬∞ √ó 0.5¬∞**.
- Log-transformed occurrence rate plots for both:
  - Background rates (from smoothed seismicity)
  - Aftershock densities (from ETAS simulations)
- Comparative overlays for visual hazard zonation.
